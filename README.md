Test in a browser
Go to http://localhost:3000 in a browser tab. Nothing should be visible as the server has not been setup to repond to that route.
Add "/filename.html" to the end of the URL (replacing filename with the name of the file you moved to the public folder).
You should see that page in the browser.
